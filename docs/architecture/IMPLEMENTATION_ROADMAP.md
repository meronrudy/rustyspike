## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a clear path from the current hSNN foundation to a transformative CLI-first research substrate. By building incrementally and maintaining backward compatibility, we can deliver value at each phase while working toward the complete vision.

The modular approach ensures that each component can be developed and tested independently, while the comprehensive testing strategy guarantees quality and determinism throughout the development process.
