## Migration Notes

### From Previous Versions

**Old API (deprecated but supported):**
```rust
let mut network = HypergraphNetwork::new();
network.add_hyperedge(hyperedge);
let output = network.process_spikes(input_spikes);
```

**New API (recommended):**
```rust
let connectivity = HypergraphNetwork::new();
let mut network = NetworkBuilder::new()
    .with_connectivity(connectivity)
    .with_neurons(NeuronConfig::lif_default(100))
    .enable_stdp()
    .build_lif()?;

let output = network.process_spikes(input_spikes)?;
```
