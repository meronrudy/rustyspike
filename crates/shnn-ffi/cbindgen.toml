  SHNN FFI C API

  - Thin-waist C ABI for building networks, running deterministic simulations,

  - Ownership: all buffers returned by the library must be freed by hsnn_free_buffer.
  - Determinism: fixed-step simulations with configurable deterministic ordering.
  - Versioning: header is generated per build; follow the projectâ€™s stability policy.

  This header is generated by cbindgen. Do not edit manually.
